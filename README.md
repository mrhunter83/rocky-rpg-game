# 'Rocky' themed web-based RPG

In this web-based RPG, users are given the choice of four iconic characters from the first four 'Rocky' films--Rocky Balboa, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Ivan Drago--to fight against an opponent of their choosing (selected from the remaining characters in roster).

INSTRUCTIONS AND MECHANNICS:
The goal of the game is to fight and survive bouts with all of the remaining contenders on the roster...
1) The player begins the game by choosing a fighter from the roster of four available.
2) Once a fighter is chosen, the player chooses their first opponent.
3) Once the fighter and opponent are chosen, the player executes 'attacks' on their opponent by pressing the 'Fight' button located under the 'fighter' and 'opponent' cards.
4) If at any point the health points of the player's chosen fighter are depleted before they have defeated all remaining opponents in the roster, the player loses the game; if they player defeats all remaining opponents on the roster before their health points are depleted, they win.
5) Once the player wins or loses, they are given the option to reset the game.
